# Contextual AI Presentation Orchestrator

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The *Contextual AI Presentation Orchestrator* is a production-ready AI system designed to automatically generate *factually accurate, context-aware presentations* (15â€“20 slides) from complex source materials. Built for *enterprise AI automation*, it solves common issues like context degradation, content hallucination, and scalability bottlenecks.  

This system integrates *LangChain orchestration, RAG pipelines, advanced context management, and multi-model optimization* to deliver enterprise-grade performance, role-based security, and monitoring capabilities.

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
âœ… *Advanced LangChain Orchestration* â€“ Multi-agent system for document analysis, outline generation, QA, and formatting.  
âœ… *Enterprise-Grade RAG Architecture* â€“ Hybrid vector search (FAISS/ChromaDB) with entity extraction and contradiction detection.  
âœ… *Context Memory Management* â€“ Persistent session state and vector-based memory for contextual integrity.  
âœ… *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* â€“ Four-tier role permissions (Executive, Senior Manager, Analyst, Junior Staff).  
âœ… *Multi-Model Optimization* â€“ Intelligent routing between primary LLM, technical models, and embedding models.  
âœ… *REST API + CLI* â€“ Full OpenAPI 3.0 specification and interactive CLI support.  
âœ… *Production-Ready Monitoring* â€“ Logging, error tracking, health checks, and performance benchmarking.
